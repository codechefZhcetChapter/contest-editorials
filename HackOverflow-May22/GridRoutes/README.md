You need to find the number of ways possible to reach the bottom right of the grid from the top left, being able to move only right and down

<b>INPUT FORMAT: </b><br>
The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer X - the length of sides of the grid

<b>OUTPUT FORMAT:</b><br>
For each test case, output the number of ways possible to reach the bottom right of the grid from the top left, with the rule as specified in the problem statement

<b>CONSTRAINTS: </b><br>
```
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= X <= 10
```

<b>SAMPLE INPUT:</b><br>
